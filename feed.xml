I use these maps to get the world positions of landmarks like delineators, road signs, trees… These landmarks are then matched with some video footage of cameras mounted on gantry bridges. My final goal is to minimize the reprojection error from the landmarks and the corresponding video pixe... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Include CMake projects from Github!</title><link href="/posts/including-cmake-github-projects/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Include CMake projects from Github!" /><published>2021-02-16T15:51:00+01:00</published> <updated>2021-02-19T17:42:25+01:00</updated> <id>/posts/including-cmake-github-projects/</id> <content src="/posts/including-cmake-github-projects/" /> <author> <name>Marcel Bruckner</name> </author> <category term="Coding" /> <summary> When I develop a CMake based project I often want to include other CMake projects into mine. Gladly CMake offers a quick and easy way on how to automatically pull the other project from Github, build it using its own CMakeLists.txt and make the results available to my own project. CMakeList.txt.in To make CMake aware of the other project just add a CMakeList.txt.in and paste the following sni... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Writing an About page!</title><link href="/posts/making-about/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Writing an About page!" /><published>2021-02-12T15:36:00+01:00</published> <updated>2021-02-19T17:42:25+01:00</updated> <id>/posts/making-about/</id> <content src="/posts/making-about/" /> <author> <name>Marcel Bruckner</name> </author> <category term="Setup" /> <summary> The first impression looks to be the most important one.

As part of this, a large sensor network system has been set up along the highway to allow monitoring and steering of traffic as well as to improve the coordination between autonomous and traditional cars. The primary task of the intelligent system is... </summary> </entry> </feed>
